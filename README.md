# RSTAR_Invoice
A simple yet effective all-in-one billing and inventory management app that keeps record of all your inventory and helps you to easily produce invoices at any time.  
  
Steps to Install:  
	The RSTAR Invoice is a simple executable file and doesn't need any installation procedure.  
	  1. Create a folder at any desired path and store the program (.exe) file.  
	  2. It creates a database named 'Product_Inventory.db' and 'Bills.db' after the 1st use, which holds your entries. It should not be deleted or shared at any cost as it is the only backup for your data.  
	  3. Simply click the program file and your personal billing and inventory management software is good to go.  
  
Steps to Update:  
	  1. Download and store the new updated program file in the same folder that you created during installation.  
	  2. Do not disturb the 'Product_Inventory.db' and 'Bills.db' file.  
	  3. Delete the old program file only and your updated program is ready to use.  
  
Steps to Delete:  
	  1. Delete the program file.  
	  2. Delete the database or store it safely at your own risk.  
  
Important Note:  
	  The developer is not responsible for any data breach/compromise of user data under any circumstance, as the user's data is in complete control of the user only.  
	  The developer does not hold any copy of user's data and hence keeping an in-program cloud backup is not possible.
